    Steps for Adding ASLR Support for TODO Architectures:

    1. **Implement ASLR:**
       - Add ASLR functionality for architectures: `alpha`, `arc`, `hexagon`, `m68k`, `microblaze`, `nios2`, `openrisc`, `sh`, `sparc`, and `xtensa`.
       - Write appropriate memory management functions and randomization algorithms for each architecture.

    2. **Documentation Updates:**
       - Create documentation explaining how ASLR works for each architecture, including configuration and example usage scenarios.

    3. **Test Scenarios:**
       - Develop test scenarios and automated testing tools to verify that ASLR is functioning correctly.
       - Ensure the test scenarios validate that memory layouts are randomized as expected.

    4. **Performance Optimizations:**
       - Analyze the performance impacts of ASLR and add optimizations if necessary.
       - Develop solutions to reduce the CPU load from randomization processes.

    5. **Developer Tools:**
       - Create tools to provide developers with information about ASLR.
       - For example, develop a CLI tool or graphical application to display ASLR status.

    6. **Security Improvements:**
       - Investigate the security implications of ASLR and evaluate its integration with protection mechanisms.
       - Identify potential security vulnerabilities and develop solutions.

    7. **Feedback Mechanism:**
       - Establish a mechanism for users and developers to provide feedback on ASLR.
       - This feedback can provide valuable insights for enhancing the feature.
